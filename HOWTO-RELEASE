	Preparing a PROJ.4 Release
	==========================


1) Update the version number in configure.in (in AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE()).

2) Update the version number in proj_api.h (#define PJ_VERSION).

3) Update the version number, and date in src/pj_release.c.

4) Update the version number in the -version-info definition in 
   src/Makefile.am.  It consists of "current:revision:age". 

   - If the library source code has changed at all since the last update, 
     then increment revision (c:r:a becomes c:r+1:a). 

   - If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last 
     update, increment current, and set revision to 0. 

   - If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then 
     increment age. 

   - If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release, then 
     set age to 0. 

5) Add a note to the ChangeLog that a new release is being issued, and what
   the release number is.

6) Tag the release with a command like "cvs tag proj_4_4_3".

7) Do a "make dist-all" in the proj root directory.  After some grinding
   this should result in files like proj-4.4.3.tar.gz and proj-4.4.3.zip
   being created.  These are full source distributions. 

8) Put these in the proj ftp area on ftp.remotesensing.org.  This can be
   done via scp using a command like the following.

     scp proj-4.4.3.{tar.gz,zip} remotesensing.org:/ftp/remotesensing/pub/proj

9) Announce the new release on the PROJ.4 mailing lists.  If the release
   is particularly significant in terms of features it might also be 
   announced in comp.infosystems.gis, os-remotesensing@remotesensing.org, 
   and freegis-list@intevation.de.  

10) Issue a new release report on Freshmeat.

NOTES:

 o Information about preparing binary releases, and RPMs should be formalized.
 o A "beta" release step should likely be incorporated.
